This project focuses on analyzing historical stock price data using manifold learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data. The dataset includes 5 years of stock price information with features like daily open, high, low, close, and volume. Additional financial indicators, such as moving averages, RSI, volatility, Bollinger Bands, and MACD, were calculated to enrich the data and provide more context for analysis. Manifold learning methods, including t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA, were applied to reduce the data's dimensionality and visualize its structure in a lower-dimensional space. The goal is to evaluate how well each technique captures meaningful relationships in the stock data, providing insights into patterns that may not be apparent in the original high-dimensional space. Through preprocessing, visualization, and comparative analysis, this study aims to identify the most effective method for understanding stock price dynamics.
