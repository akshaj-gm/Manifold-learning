Stock market data is high-dimensional, with features like prices, volumes, and technical indicators, making its storage and analysis computationally expensive. To address this, dimensionality reduction methods are applied to represent the data in lower dimensions while retaining critical patterns for efficient processing.
The real challenge lies in achieving age-invariant facial recognition. However, due to computational limitations, we used stock price data as a test case to replicate the prob- lem. We employed manifold learning techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to reduce the dimensionality of the stock data and capture its essen- tial patterns. After dimensionality reduction, we used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for reconstruction. These models were trained to reconstruct the original data from its reduced representation, allowing us to assess how well the reduced data could maintain the critical features of the original time- series data.
